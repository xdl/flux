#+STARTUP: showall

* PoC

** DONE Get cloning to work
   CLOSED: [2017-12-16 Sat 02:55]
   Using ~.cloneNode~, but we'll also need to recursively resolve ~<use>~ elements

* API

** DONE addChild, removeChild
   CLOSED: [2017-12-16 Sat 19:56]
** DONE Be able to refer to instances
   CLOSED: [2017-12-16 Sat 19:40]
   e.g. ~library.apps().play_btn.addEventListener("click", () => {})~
** DONE ~addEventListener~
   CLOSED: [2017-12-16 Sat 02:55]
   Do the common events: 'click', 'mouseover', 'mouseout'

* Implementation

** TODO Figure out how to embed fonts
** TODO Be able to change text on ~tspan~ elements
** DONE Consider only populating library with direct descendants of layers
   CLOSED: [2018-01-02 Tue 01:39]
   This will stop polluting the library namespace but wondering if it's necessary at all?

* Bugs

** TODO Petweetdish: Background for button not showing up [1/2]
   - [X] Reproduce. Issue was to do with cloning a ~rect~
   - [ ] Fix
** TODO Diagram connectors
   These don't work. But they don't particularly work in Inkscape either

* UX

** DONE Marvel-esque clickbox
   CLOSED: [2017-12-22 Fri 15:02]
   Can find better animation probably but it works
   Going to need to insert a translucent wrapping node in there; for overlapping hitareas
** TODO Flashy transition animations
   E.g. Framer-esque ones
